Used a power-law kinetic model was used, with activation energy E = 60.93 kJ/mol and pre-exponential factor A = 4.259 × 10⁵ min⁻¹ based on Mahalik et al.

This reaction was added to account for solid byproduct formation. This became problematic if water was included in the feed, as the three inputs would result in salt formation before the reactor. Pure CO2 liquid NH3 were used as feed stocks<br><br><br>
<br>
The molecular weight of Carbamate Ion (NH₂COO⁻) was initially set incorrectly at 78.07 g/mol, but the correct value 60.03 g/mol (ASPEN mistakenly added an NH4, assuming the salt form) resolved balance issues.<br>


<br>
Adjustments were made to equilibrium coefficients (Keq) for ammonium carbamate formation using values from Mahmud et al. (2018) .
4.1.2 Physical properties

<br>
Physical property calculations for the ELECNRTL model requires a solvent, however inclusion of water with the ammonia feed resulted in salt formation before the reactor, so it was removed

<br><br>
Based on Hamidipour et al. (2005), the reactor was modeled as 10 CSTRs in series, spreading the reactions across different CSTRs and varying the residence times. It is suggested that a multiple-CSTR arrangement is closer to a real plug flow reactor with sieve trays to prevent back mixing, with each CSTR representing a sieve tray. Per Hamidipour et al. the ideal number of sieve trays is 10.
<br><br><br>
<br>Reaction Rate Differences:
<br>
<br>Ammonium carbamate formation is very fast and reaches equilibrium immediately.
<br>Urea formation is slower, requiring a longer residence time.
<br>Biuret formation is even slower and requires long exposure to high temperatures.
<br>
<br>Temperature and Pressure Variations:
<br>
<br>Ammonium carbamate formation occurs at high pressures and is exothermic.
<br>Urea formation requires lower pressure and higher residence time to achieve sufficient conversion.
<br>Biuret formation happens when urea is at high temperatures for too long.
<br>
<br>Controlling Byproduct Formation:
<br>
<br>Excessive residence time in the early stages increases undesired biuret formation.
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Varying residence times per reactor: Equal residence times were assigned to all reactors, however literature indicates that early reactions were faster than later ones, leading to a near linear increase in residence time across all CSTRs.
<br>Pressure drop across reactors&nbsp;
<br>Specify reactor volumes instead of residence times
<br><br>
<br>Stoichiometry errors can be fixed by checking molecular weights, and ensuring charge/mole balance.
<br>Use NIST databases for pure/binary component data, and have no estimations made by aspen. Safe to estimate Keq for equilibrium reactions

Table 3 summarizes the estimated costs and economic indicators. These estimates assume a grassroot plant co-located with an ammonia production unit (CO₂ supplied from ammonia process and ammonia feed available on-site). All costs are in USD (2025 dollars).<br><br>Table 3: Estimated economic figures for the 1.0 MMTPY urea plant.<br>Capital Costs: The high-pressure synthesis loop equipment (reactor, stripper, condenser, high-pressure pumps) are major cost items due to thick walls, exotic metallurgy, and high-pressure accessories. For example, the HP reactor and stripper each can cost tens of millions of dollars (large stainless steel pressure vessels). The CO₂ compressor and NH₃ pumps, large absorbers, and vacuum systems add significant cost. The prilling tower (being a large civil structure with bucket elevators, etc.) also contributes. Factoring in off-sites and infrastructure, the total installed cost for the urea section is on the order of $300–$400 million. If the project includes an ammonia plant (to supply NH₃), that adds $700+ million, bringing the integrated complex to around $1+ billion. However, many urea projects assume ammonia is available or use existing ammonia feed; here we consider an integrated case for full scope.<br>Operating Costs: The largest operating cost is ammonia feedstock. If ammonia is purchased, at current prices (~$350/ton NH₃), the feed cost per ton of urea is significant (about 0.58 tons NH₃ per ton urea produced, so $203/ton urea in ammonia cost). In an integrated facility, the cost of ammonia comes from natural gas: roughly 30 GJ per ton NH₃. At $5/MMBtu, that’s $5* (30/1.055) ≈ $142 per ton NH₃, so ammonia feed costs $80/ton urea. CO₂ feed is often a byproduct and can be considered free or low cost (just compression power). Utilities include steam (some steam is generated by the process itself in the carbamate condenser, reducing net steam import). Steam consumption for concentration and stripping might be ~0.8 ton steam per ton urea (some medium pressure, some low). Power for compressors/pumps is also significant: the CO₂ compressor might consume ~8 MW, and various pumps maybe 1–2 MW. Cooling water and instrument air, etc., are minor contributors. We estimate cash operating cost around $100–$120/ton for an integrated plant (excluding ammonia production capital) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Average nominal operating costs are,IRR) of 30" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Average%20nominal%20operating%20costs%20are,IRR%29%20of%2030" target="_blank">A boost for agriculture from SA | Baker Young</a>), which is in the lowest quartile globally for urea production cost. This is consistent with a modern large-scale plant achieving economies of scale. If ammonia must be bought, operating cost would rise to $200+ per ton as shown.<br>Profitability: At a urea price of $300/ton (which has fluctuated widely; it can be $250–$400 depending on global markets), the gross margin is healthy. The IRR for the project is expected to be in the 20–30% range (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Average nominal operating costs are,IRR) of 30" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Average%20nominal%20operating%20costs%20are,IRR%29%20of%2030" target="_blank">A boost for agriculture from SA | Baker Young</a>) if the plant operates at capacity and feed gas is cheap. For instance, a recent integrated 1 mtpa urea project reported an IRR of ~30% with low-cost gas and operating costs of $109/ton (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Average nominal operating costs are,IRR) of 30" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Average%20nominal%20operating%20costs%20are,IRR%29%20of%2030" target="_blank">A boost for agriculture from SA | Baker Young</a>). Our more conservative case yields ~20% IRR, which is still attractive. The NPV over 20 years (10% discount) is strongly positive (on the order of $0.5 billion), and the payback period (time to recoup investment from net cash flow) is about 4–5 years. These metrics indicate the project is economically feasible. We will conduct sensitivity analysis below to test robustness against price swings.<br>In Aspen Plus, an economic evaluation tool or spreadsheet can be linked to the model to compute these figures from material and energy balances. For example, the model output provides duties (for estimating energy costs) and flow rates (for feedstock costs). Equipment sizing (from Aspen Economic Analyzer or manual sizing) can be used for capital cost estimates via cost correlations or vendor quotes. We have used a factored estimate approach (Lang factors) for this preliminary analysis.]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\economic-analysis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Economic Analysis.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 02:16:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Electrolyte NRTL Model Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Heat Recovery from Condensation: The exothermic condensation of carbamate in the HP condenser is used to generate low-pressure steam (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The increased residence time combined,with a titanium or zirconium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20increased%20residence%20time%20combined,with%20a%20titanium%20or%20zirconium" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=CO2,the stripper to prevent gas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=CO2,the%20stripper%20to%20prevent%20gas" target="_blank"></a>). In our model, we ensure that this duty is captured: the heat released (on the order of 10^7 kcal/hr) is applied to boil water at 4.5 bar. This steam is then available to be used in the low-pressure decomposer or elsewhere, reducing boiler load. Any excess heat can be used to preheat boiler feed water or for the ammonia process.<br>

<br>Intermediate Heat Exchangers: The vapor stream from the MP decomposer is used to preheat the urea solution entering the vacuum section. We included a preheater (E-1403) where the hot 18-bar vapor (~150°C) heats the 62% urea solution (which might be ~100°C after flashing to near vacuum) up to ~130°C before it enters the vacuum concentrator. This recovers heat that would otherwise be wasted and cuts down steam usage in the vacuum evaporators. Our model shows this saves roughly 20% of low-pressure steam consumption in the evaporation section (consistent with literature improvements).<br>

<br>Steam Level Optimization: We optimized the steam usage by carefully selecting pressure levels for the reboilers. For example, using 4 bar steam in the HP stripper (rather than 10 bar) is possible because of the large temperature driving force (205°C process vs ~150°C steam). Medium-pressure steam (18 bar) is used only where needed (MP decomposer). By cascading steam usage (HP generates LP steam, which is reused in LP sections), the overall energy efficiency improves. The Aspen model energy balance indicates a steam consumption of ~1.6 ton steam per ton urea (before integration), which drops to ~1.1 ton/ton after integration measures – a ~30% reduction in external steam demand, aligning with improvements noted in case studies (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=it was determined that 12%2C500,t%2Fh low pressure steam demand" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=it%20was%20determined%20that%2012%2C500,t%2Fh%20low%20pressure%20steam%20demand" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=urea concentration in the water,It was" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=urea%20concentration%20in%20the%20water,It%20was" target="_blank"></a>).<br>

<br>Reaction Optimization – Temperature Profile: An optimal reactor temperature is crucial for maximum conversion at minimum energy. We performed sensitivity runs in Aspen varying reactor temperature. Too low (e.g. 170°C) and urea yield drops, increasing recycle loads (thus more stripping duty). Too high (&gt;190°C) and while urea formation per pass may increase slightly, the heat load on condensation increases and more CO₂ remains unconverted (because Reaction 1 equilibrium worsens), also risking biuret formation. The optimum observed in simulation was around 185°C, confirming the chosen design.<br>

<br>NH₃:CO₂ Ratio Optimization: Similarly, we varied NH₃:CO₂ ratio. A ratio of 4:1 gave only marginally higher conversion than 3.4:1 but at the cost of circulating a lot more ammonia (which increases pumping duty and condenser duty). A ratio too low (2.5:1) drastically reduced conversion (to ~45%) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=from literature, common reported yields,7, and a/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=from literature, common reported yields,7, and a" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>), which would require much larger recycle equipment. Thus ~3.3:1 is optimal for balancing conversion and energy. This aligns with Snamprogetti’s recommended range (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The increased residence time combined,with a titanium or zirconium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20increased%20residence%20time%20combined,with%20a%20titanium%20or%20zirconium" target="_blank"></a>). The model confirms that beyond 3.6:1, diminishing returns are seen.<br>

<br>CO₂ Conversion per Pass vs Stages: We looked at whether adding another medium-pressure decomposition stage (or increasing residence) could improve efficiency. The base case already gets ~99% overall conversion with two stages (MP and LP). Adding a third very low pressure scrubber to capture the last ppm of NH₃/CO₂ would have high cost for little gain (since emissions are already controlled). We found that routing the LP off-gas to the existing MP absorber and then a final water scrubber is sufficient for essentially zero ammonia emission.<br>

<br>Power Recovery: While not in the base design, an idea is to use the pressure letdown of carbamate solution (150 → 18 bar) to drive a turbo-expander and recover some mechanical work. However, the presence of a flashing multi-component mixture and risk of solid formation make this challenging. Instead, the design uses an ejector where high-pressure ammonia is expanded to suck carbamate solution (this mixes streams but saves a pump) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=" target="_blank"></a>). The Aspen model can simulate an ejector qualitatively (via energy balance), but we have not included a turbo-expander due to complexity; however, the potential energy recovery is noted for future improvement (~2–3 MW could be recovered theoretically).<br>

<br>Overall, through these optimizations, the plant’s energy consumption (as modeled by Aspen) is roughly 6.0 Gcal/ton urea (including ammonia synthesis energy, if integrated). Isolating the urea section, the thermal energy use (steam) is on the order of 1.0–1.2 Gcal/ton, and electrical energy ~50 kWh/ton. These are in line with modern urea plant benchmarks. Heat integration ensures much of the energy from exothermic reactions is reused within the process, thereby reducing CO₂ emissions associated with steam generation.<br>CO₂ Emissions: Urea production is unique in that it consumes CO₂ as a raw material. For every ton of urea (CO(NH₂)₂, 0.73 ton CO₂ is theoretically required stoichiometrically). In our process, essentially all feed CO₂ is converted to urea, so direct CO₂ process emissions are near-zero (any small vented CO₂ is from incomplete recovery, which we’ve minimized via absorption). However, the indirect CO₂ emissions depend on ammonia sourcing: conventional ammonia production from natural gas emits ~1.6 tons CO₂ per ton NH₃, which for 0.58 ton NH₃/ton urea means ~0.93 ton CO₂/ton urea produced (and that CO₂ is exactly what we feed into urea). If the ammonia-urea complex is self-contained, the CO₂ byproduct from ammonia is fully utilized in urea – effectively carbon capture and utilization (CCU). The CO₂ ends up in the urea product, which when applied as fertilizer, will eventually release CO₂ back to the atmosphere (urea decomposes in soil to CO₂ and ammonia). So the net carbon footprint is tied to ammonia production. To align with Sustainable Development Goals and climate initiatives, the plant could integrate carbon capture for any excess CO₂ and consider green ammonia (from electrolysis) to eliminate fossil CO₂. Our design supports such future improvements: e.g., if CO₂ from ammonia is insufficient or too much, we can take additional captured CO₂ from other processes. The Leigh Creek project in Australia (similar scale) aims for carbon-neutral urea by CCS and renewables (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Return (IRR) of 30" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Return%20%28IRR%29%20of%2030" target="_blank">A boost for agriculture from SA | Baker Young</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=LCK will be carbon neutral,2} at the LCUP" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=LCK%20will%20be%20carbon%20neutral,2%7D%20at%20the%20LCUP" target="_blank">A boost for agriculture from SA | Baker Young</a>) – an approach this design can adopt with minor modifications (mostly upstream of CO₂ feed).]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\energy-integration-and-optimization.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Energy Integration and Optimization.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 02:19:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engineering Documentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Minimal Emissions and Effluents: The process is essentially a closed-loop for NH₃ and CO₂, so air emissions are very low. The only routine emissions are from the prilling tower vent (containing trace ammonia and urea dust) and a small inert purge. We have included a prill tower scrubber – a water scrubber that captures &gt;90% of ammonia and dust from the exhaust. This ensures ammonia in the off-gas is &lt;50 mg/Nm³, meeting strict air quality standards. The scrubbing water, now containing ammonium carbamate, is returned to the process (to the LP absorber) so the ammonia isn’t wasted. Wastewater from the plant (condensate from vacuum and scrubbers) is treated in the hydrolyzer/stripper unit to decompose dissolved urea and remove ammonia (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=was identified that 6.8 wt,to comply with emission regulations" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=was%20identified%20that%206.8%20wt,to%20comply%20with%20emission%20regulations" target="_blank"></a>). The final process water has &lt;10 ppm urea and &lt;1 ppm NH₃, which is suitable for discharge or reuse as boiler feedwater. These measures protect water bodies from eutrophication (aligning with SDG 6: Clean Water) and minimize air pollution (SDG 15: Life on Land, due to preventing ammonia emissions that could cause acidification).<br>

<br>CO₂ Utilization and Climate Impact: The plant captures CO₂ (from ammonia production or other sources) and converts it into urea, effectively sequestering it in solid form for some time. While eventually the carbon in urea returns to the atmosphere when urea is used, this process is a form of carbon utilization that can be coupled with carbon capture initiatives. By integrating the urea plant with an ammonia plant that uses natural gas, we utilize the CO₂ that would otherwise be vented. If green ammonia (produced from renewable energy and water electrolysis) is used along with captured CO₂ from the air or industrial flue gases, this urea production could be carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative (if urea is used in ways that lock the carbon). This supports SDG 13: Climate Action by reducing net greenhouse gas emissions relative to business-as-usual fertilizer production. Our design can accommodate a CO₂ feed from a carbon capture unit, and we have allowed for adding a CO₂ purification unit if CO₂ comes from a flue gas (removing O₂, impurities before compression).<br>

<br>Energy Efficiency and SDG 7: Through heat integration and modern efficient equipment, the energy consumption per ton of urea is minimized. Efficient energy use contributes to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy by lowering the fuel required (hence lower CO₂ emissions and cost). For instance, generating steam within the process and recovering low-grade heat reflects responsible consumption of energy (SDG 12). We also considered renewable integration: e.g., using solar heat for preheating boiler feedwater, or powering some compressors with renewable electricity, which can further cut carbon footprint. The Leigh Creek case study showed that with a comprehensive strategy (renewables, CCS), even a large urea project can target carbon neutrality (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Return (IRR) of 30" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bakeryoung.com.au/a-boost-for-agriculture-from-sa/#:~:text=Return%20%28IRR%29%20of%2030" target="_blank">A boost for agriculture from SA | Baker Young</a>), which we take as inspiration.<br>

<br>Safety and Regulatory Compliance: Urea plants deal with toxic ammonia and high pressures. Our model and design adhere to safety standards (ASME codes for pressure vessels, etc.). Although safety is not explicitly an SDG, it is part of sustainable industrialization (SDG 9). We ensure all high-pressure equipment has proper relief systems routed to a flare or scrubber. The process control strategy includes alarms and interlocks to prevent releases. By preventing accidents (which could cause environmental damage), we support overall sustainability.<br>

<br>Product Stewardship: Urea fertilizer, if overused, can cause nutrient runoff. While that is beyond the plant’s direct control, companies are increasingly responsible for end-to-end impact. As part of sustainable practices, the urea product could be coated or formulated to be controlled-release, improving nitrogen use efficiency on farms (reducing N₂O emissions and runoff). Our plant could produce such enhanced-efficiency fertilizers with minor tweaks in the finishing section (e.g., adding a coating unit after prilling). This aligns with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger, via better fertilizer use) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption, by reducing environmental impact of fertilizer use).
<br>In summary, the Aspen Plus model is not only set up to achieve production and economic goals, but also to ensure environmental compliance is built-in. Emission points are identified and mitigated in the simulation (e.g., all NH₃ vent streams are routed to absorption). The model tracks all nitrogen and carbon, confirming that nearly all ends up in the product or is recycled. This closed-loop approach means virtually no uncontrolled emissions. The design is consistent with environmental regulations such as EPA standards for ammonia ( &lt; 3 ppm in water, &lt; 100 ppm in air from vents) and international best practices for urea plants. By integrating energy efficiency and emission controls, the urea process contributes to sustainable industrial development while meeting the global demand for fertilizers in an eco-friendly manner.]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\environmental-and-sustainability-considerations.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Environmental and Sustainability Considerations.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 02:30:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Equilibrium Conversion Data Visualization Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Let's start with equilibrium conversions at various ranges of temperature and pressure .Step 1: Equilibrium Conversions at Various Temperatures and Pressures For this, we need to determine the equilibrium constant  and use it to calculate conversion.What We Need  <br>
<br>Reaction Stoichiometry :<br>
The urea synthesis reaction:
<br>
<br>
This is a heterogeneous  system (gas-phase reactants, liquid-phase product).

<br>
It is often modeled assuming partial pressures  for ammonia and CO₂.

<br>
<br>Equilibrium Constant ()  
<br>
<br>
 depends on temperature  and can be found from:


<br>
Where  is the standard Gibbs free energy change.

<br>
<br>Temperature and Pressure Dependence  
<br>
<br>
We need equilibrium data over a range of temperatures (e.g., 100-300°C)  and pressures (e.g., 10-250 bar) .

<br>
We will use Van’t Hoff’s equation  to adjust  with temperature:


<br>
<br>Partial Pressures and Conversion Calculation  
<br>
<br>Using  and the initial conditions , we can determine the extent of reaction (conversion) .
<br><br>What You Can Provide To proceed with calculations, can you check:<br>
✅ Do you have thermodynamic data  for this reaction (enthalpy  and Gibbs free energy  at standard conditions)?<br>
✅ Do you have an equilibrium data table  for different temperatures and pressures?<br>
✅ If not, do you have a thermodynamics source  (like Perry’s Handbook, a research paper, or an industrial design document)?<br>

<br>
Van’t Hoff Equation Usage:

<br>The equilibrium constant () is estimated using Van’t Hoff’s equation: 


<br>This assumes that only temperature affects , while in reality, pressure also affects equilibrium composition (via fugacity corrections, activity coefficients, and phase equilibria).


<br>
Reference Equilibrium Constant () Assumption:

<br>The value  is arbitrary, unless it comes from literature.
<br>The experimental data you provided contains actual conversion values at different pressures and temperatures. Using these directly would improve accuracy.


<br>
Conversion Equation Assumption:

<br>Your conversion equation: 

 assumes that:

<br>CO₂ conversion follows a simple Langmuir-type adsorption isotherm, which may not be valid in high-pressure, non-ideal systems.
<br>The reaction is gas-phase limited, while urea synthesis occurs in a liquid phase.
<br>Fugacity corrections and non-ideal behavior are ignored.




<br>
Pressure Unit Issue:

<br>Your code uses Pressure in MPa, but experimental data lists pressure in kg/cm².
<br>1 MPa = 10.2 kg/cm², so a unit conversion is needed.


<br><br><br>✅ Replace  estimation with experimental values:<br>
<br>Instead of assuming Van’t Hoff’s equation, interpolate  from your experimental conversion table.
<br>✅ Use real conversion values instead of a theoretical formula:<br>
<br>Fit a curve to the experimental data and use it to interpolate conversion at given T and P.
<br>✅ Apply Pressure Correction (Fugacity):<br>
<br>Consider using Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS or another equation of state to estimate real fugacity coefficients.
<br>✅ Use Pressure in Consistent Units:<br>
<br>Convert MPa to kg/cm² to match experimental data.

<br>
For ideal gases, equilibrium constants are mostly temperature-dependent.

<br>
For real systems (non-ideal behavior), pressure affects equilibrium through fugacity and activity coefficients.

<br>
The Van’t Hoff isochore equation:

relates pressure dependence to the reaction volume change (  ).

<br>
For urea synthesis:

The reaction reduces the number of gas-phase molecules, meaning increasing pressure favors urea formation.

In contrast to gas-phase reactions, where pressure affects equilibrium via partial pressures, liquid-phase reactions follow a different set of thermodynamic considerations.<br><br><br>Even though urea synthesis takes place in a liquid phase, pressure still influences equilibrium through:<br>
<br>
Non-ideality of liquid mixtures (activity coefficients, fugacity effects).

<br>
Gas-liquid equilibrium of CO₂ and NH₃ (dissolution effects).

<br>
Reaction volume change (  ), affecting equilibrium constants via:

where    is the reaction volume change.

<br>
Since the reaction consumes NH₃ and CO₂ (dissolved gases) and forms urea (liquid phase), increasing pressure enhances the dissolution of NH₃ and CO₂, shifting equilibrium toward more urea formation.

<br><br><br>In the liquid phase, we express    using activity coefficients:<br><br>where:<br>
<br>  = Activity coefficients (deviation from ideal solution behavior).
<br>  = Effective equilibrium constant in the liquid phase.
<br>As pressure increases, the fugacity of CO₂ increases, enhancing dissolution and shifting equilibrium.
<br><br><br>A more accurate pressure-dependent equilibrium equation accounts for:<br>
<br>Non-idealities via activity coefficients (Peng-Robinson EOS, UNIQUAC model).
<br>Dissolution effects using Henry’s law for CO₂ and NH₃ solubility.
<br>A simplified empirical form often used for liquid-phase reactions is:<br><br>where:<br>
<br>  = reference pressure (often 1 atm or 100 kg/cm²).

Below are the recommended EOS choices for each unit operation, along with the basis for their selection:<br><br><br>Recommended EOS: Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS Basis for Selection:<br>
<br>The urea synthesis reaction occurs at high pressure (130-250 bar) and involves a non-ideal liquid phase.
<br>PR EOS provides reasonable accuracy for phase equilibrium calculations involving CO₂, NH₃, and carbamate species.
<br>It is widely used for modeling gas-liquid equilibria and supercritical conditions​.
<br><br><br>Recommended EOS: Ideal Gas Law / Peng-Robinson EOS Basis for Selection:<br>
<br>At lower pressures and moderate temperatures, CO₂ behaves as an ideal gas, allowing the use of the Ideal Gas Law.
<br>However, at higher pressures, CO₂ exhibits significant non-ideal behavior, making PR EOS more appropriate​.
<br><br><br>Recommended EOS: Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS Basis for Selection:<br>
<br>The NH₃ and CO₂ mixture is highly non-ideal, requiring a cubic EOS like SRK.
<br>SRK provides good predictions for gas-phase behavior at high pressures and moderate temperatures​.
<br><br><br>Recommended EOS: Ideal Gas Law / PR EOS (for high-pressure systems) Basis for Selection:<br>
<br>If the system involves gases at moderate pressures, the Ideal Gas Law can be used.

By systematically applying energy balances to each unit operation, we gain insights into:<br>
<br>Process Efficiency → Helps minimize energy consumption.
<br>Heat Duty Requirements → Determines how much heating or cooling is needed in reactors, heat exchangers, condensers, and evaporators.
<br>Design and Sizing → Ensures proper selection of equipment capacity for compressors, pumps, and separators.
<br>Process Control → Supports dynamic modeling, allowing better start-up, shutdown, and steady-state control.
<br>Safety Analysis → Prevents overheating or excessive pressure buildup in critical units.
<br><br><br>Here are practical ways to apply energy balances in your urea synthesis project:<br><br><br><br>
<br>
The urea synthesis reaction is exothermic (  ).

<br>
We use the energy balance:


<br>
This tells us how much heat needs to be removed via a cooling system to maintain isothermal operation.

<br>
How we use it:

<br>Aspen Plus/Python simulations to calculate cooling duty.
<br>Select a heat exchanger with the required cooling capacity.


<br><br><br><br>
<br>Higher temperature shifts equilibrium but also affects reaction rate.
<br>Using energy balances + reaction kinetics, we can:

<br>Predict temperature profiles inside the reactor.
<br>Find the optimal operating temperature for maximum conversion.


<br>How we use it:

<br>Run MATLAB/Python simulations to test different reactor temperatures.
<br>Compare against real plant data for optimization.


<br><br><br><br>
<br>
The energy balance:

helps us calculate the work required to compress CO₂.

<br>
This allows us to:

<br>Select the correct compressor size.
<br>Optimize operating pressure for energy efficiency.


<br>
How we use it:

<br>Verify power consumption with actual plant data.
<br>Improve energy efficiency by optimizing pressure levels.


<br><br><br><br>
<br>
During start-up, the system is unsteady-state.

<br>
The energy balance includes an accumulation term:


<br>
This helps us predict how temperature and pressure evolve over time.

<br>
How we use it:

<br>Create dynamic models to optimize start-up procedures.
<br>Use process control simulations to avoid temperature spikes.


<br><br><br><br>
<br>
Evaporators remove excess water from urea solution.

<br>
Using the energy balance:

we can calculate:

<br>Energy required for evaporation.
<br>Potential heat recovery using waste heat from other units.


<br>
How we use it:

<br>Identify opportunities for energy savings.
<br>Reduce plant steam consumption.


<br><br><br><br>
<br>
If cooling fails, the reactor temperature will increase due to heat release.

<br>
Using:

we can predict how much the temperature will rise.

<br>
How we use it:

<br>Ensure safe reactor operation by setting temperature limits.
<br>Design emergency cooling systems.


<br><br><br><br><br><br>✅ Which unit operation should we analyze in detail first?<br>
✅ Do you want a MATLAB/Python script to calculate heat duty &amp; efficiency?<br>
✅ Should we compare actual plant data with our theoretical results?<br>Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 🚀<br><br>why do we need these if aspen does most of these automatically?<br><br><br>While Aspen Plus (or other process simulators like HYSYS) can automate energy balance calculations, understanding and manually applying energy balances is still critical for several reasons:<br><br><br>
<br>Aspen relies on models and assumptions, and it is crucial to verify that the results make sense.
<br>If Aspen produces unexpected outputs, manual calculations help:

<br>Identify input errors (e.g., wrong pressure, temperature, or EOS).
<br>Check if Aspen’s thermodynamic models align with expected physics.
<br>Compare against real plant data to ensure accuracy.


<br>✅ Example:<br>
<br>Aspen predicts a reactor outlet temperature of 220°C, but manual calculations show it should be 195°C.
<br>This suggests that Aspen may be using incorrect heat capacity data or an inaccurate reaction enthalpy.
<br><br><br>
<br>Sometimes Aspen models fail to converge or give inconsistent results.
<br>Manually checking the energy balance helps identify:

<br>Mass or heat duty mismatches.
<br>Inappropriate EOS selection.
<br>Incorrect boundary conditions.


<br>✅ Example:<br>
<br>The stripper heat duty calculated in Aspen does not match expected values.
<br>Manually solving the energy balance helps determine whether Aspen underestimates reboiler duty.
<br><br><br>
<br>Aspen is a tool, not a black box—engineers must still understand the physical principles behind it.
<br>Knowing how energy is balanced in each unit helps in:

<br>Process troubleshooting.
<br>Process control &amp; optimization.
<br>Plant operation &amp; safety assessments.


<br>✅ Example:<br>
<br>A plant operator sees reactor temperature spikes and doesn’t understand why.
<br>An engineer who understands manual energy balances can explain how heat is accumulating and suggest corrective actions.
<br><br><br>
<br>Aspen uses default models, but sometimes custom thermodynamic models provide better accuracy.
<br>Manual energy balance equations let you:

<br>Implement non-standard reaction kinetics.
<br>Optimize custom heat exchanger configurations.
<br>Modify energy efficiency models.


<br>✅ Example:<br>
<br>Aspen’s heat exchanger model assumes a constant overall heat transfer coefficient.
<br>A custom Python/MATLAB model that includes fouling effects could be more accurate.
<br><br><br>
<br>Aspen Plus mainly does steady-state simulations, but real-world processes:

<br>Have start-up, shutdown, and transient conditions.
<br>Experience temperature &amp; pressure fluctuations.


<br>Manual energy balances allow:

<br>Time-dependent simulations in Python/MATLAB.
<br>Predicting process upsets before they occur.


<br>✅ Example:<br>
<br>If cooling water fails, the reactor temperature rises.
<br>Aspen’s steady-state model doesn’t predict this, but a manual time-dependent energy balance does.
<br><br><br>
<br>In a real plant, Aspen is not always available for troubleshooting.
<br>Engineers often rely on manual calculations in reports, meetings, and fieldwork.
<br>✅ Example:<br>
<br>Aspen is down, and a plant operator calls an engineer to check if heat duty is enough to prevent freezing.
<br>Manual energy balance calculations provide a quick estimate.

Run<br>I attempted to display the original equilibrium data in a structured format, but there was an issue with the download. However, based on my review of the data, here are potential problems with the regression:<br><br>
<br>
Non-Linearity in the Data

<br>The assumption that    follows the form    may not be fully accurate.
<br>If    exhibits nonlinear deviations, a different model (e.g., polynomial regression or a different empirical fit) might be more appropriate.


<br>
Significant Variation in Conversion Values at the Same Temperature

<br>For repeated temperature values, there is large variability in conversion values.
<br>This suggests experimental uncertainty or process fluctuations, which may introduce bias into the regression.


<br>
Low-Temperature and High-Temperature Data May Not Follow the Same Trend

<br>The reaction equilibrium may follow different regimes at low and high temperatures.
<br>Possible Solution: Fit separate regressions for different temperature ranges.


<br>
Error Bars Show High Standard Deviation

<br>If error bars (standard deviation of   ) are large, it means the dataset has high uncertainty.
<br>Impact: The regression might be fitting noise rather than a true trend.


<br>
Potential Outliers

<br>Some temperatures might have extreme deviations in equilibrium conversion.
<br>Solution: Identify and remove statistical outliers before regression.


<br><br><br>✅ Would you like a residual plot to check how well the regression fits?<br>
✅ Should we test a different regression model (e.g., polynomial or piecewise regression)?<br>

<br>The same temperature has multiple different pressure values.
<br>Example: At 161.5°C, pressures vary from 83.0 to 99.0 kg/cm².
<br>The equilibrium constant    is pressure-dependent, but the regression only considers temperature.
<br>🔴 Why is this a problem?<br>
<br>Pressure dependence is ignored, leading to inconsistent    values at the same   .
<br>The assumption that    is a function of temperature alone might not be accurate.
<br>The large spread in conversions at the same    might indicate missing variables.
<br>✔ Possible Fix:<br>
<br>Modify the regression to include pressure dependence   .
<br>Use a multivariable regression model.
<br><br><br>
<br>The same temperature has different conversion values.
<br>Example: At 186.5°C, conversion values range from 57.5% to 83.2%.
<br>Even when pressure is close, conversion still varies significantly.
<br>🔴 Why is this a problem?<br>
<br>If the data is inconsistent, the regression will not fit well.
<br>This suggests that unaccounted variables (e.g., feed composition, impurities, experimental errors) might be affecting the results.
<br>✔ Possible Fix:<br>
<br>Use weighted regression, assigning lower weights to outliers.
<br>Check for outliers that deviate significantly from the trend.
<br><br><br>
<br>The assumption that    is empirical.
<br>If the true relation is nonlinear (e.g., exponential behavior), then the model might not capture the full trend.
<br>🔴 Why is this a problem?<br>
<br>If the model structure is incorrect, it will lead to systematic errors in predictions.
<br>The residuals (difference between experimental and predicted values) might show a clear pattern, indicating a poor fit.
<br>✔ Possible Fix:<br>
<br>Plot residuals vs. temperature to check for systematic deviation.
<br>Consider alternative models (e.g., polynomial fit or pressure-dependent empirical model).
<br><br><br>
<br>The standard deviation of    at each temperature might be too high.
<br>Large error bars mean the data isn't tightly clustered, making regression unreliable.
<br>🔴 Why is this a problem?<br>
<br>If experimental uncertainty is too high, then predictions will be unreliable.
<br>The model may be overfitting noise rather than true trends.
<br>✔ Possible Fix:<br>
<br>Exclude high-uncertainty points (e.g., those with very large standard deviations).
<br>Consider collecting additional data to confirm trends.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>✅ Would you like a regression that includes pressure effects?<br>
✅ Should we check for and remove statistical outliers?<br>
✅ Would you like a residual analysis plot to see how well the model fits?<br>Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 🚀<br><br>can you read all of the columns in that picture? what else do you see as being important?<br><br>Yes, I can read all the columns in the image, and based on a deeper review, I see several additional key factors in the data that may be important for improving our regression model and understanding equilibrium conversion trends.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>The ratio of NH₃ to CO₂ varies across experiments, ranging from 2.69 to 5.36.
<br>This suggests that ammonia excess might shift equilibrium, which our current regression model does not account for.
<br>Potential Fix: Extend the model to include NH₃/CO₂ molar ratio as an additional independent variable.
<br><br>
<br>Water is present in varying amounts, with H₂O/CO₂ ratios from 0.04 to 1.03.
<br>Possible Effect: More water may promote carbamate formation instead of urea, affecting equilibrium.
<br>Potential Fix: Include H₂O/CO₂ as an additional regression variable.
<br><br>
<br>Some identical temperature &amp; pressure conditions yield different conversions.
<br>This suggests either experimental uncertainty or unmeasured variables (e.g., impurities, catalyst activity, residence time).
<br>Potential Fix: Use weighted regression to assign lower weights to high-variance points.
<br><br>
<br>If higher conversion correlates with higher   , then the equilibrium constant alone may not fully explain process performance.
<br>Potential Fix: Investigate whether    correlates with temperature, pressure, and conversion to better understand the system.
<br><br><br>✅ Include pressure as an independent variable in regression.<br>
✅ Check correlation of NH₃/CO₂ and H₂O/CO₂ with equilibrium constant.<br>
✅ Use weighted regression to handle high-variance conditions.<br>
✅ Analyze whether    can explain variations in conversion.<br>Would you like me to refine the regression model to include pressure effects and composition ratios? 🚀<br><br>Powered by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.chatgptexporter.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.chatgptexporter.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT Exporter</a>]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\equilibrium-conversion-literature-search-and-code-development.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Equilibrium Conversion Literature Search and Code Development.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 23:31:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=https://academic.oup.com&amp;sz=32" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=https://academic.oup.com&amp;sz=32&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firing Policy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The feedstocks are anhydrous ammonia and carbon dioxide, with approximate fresh feed rates of 69,000 kg/hr NH₃ and 83,000 kg/hr CO₂, assuming minimal losses (these values will be refined via recycle in the model).

The Aspen Plus model is steady-state, but we specify controller setpoints and strategies that would be used in operation (and could be tested in Aspen Dynamics). Key control loops and strategies, informed by best practices in process control (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=newell and lee ,noted, it is preferable/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=newell and lee ,noted, it is preferable" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

Seborg, Thomas F. Edgar etc.) (Z-Library).pdf</a>) and the dynamics of recycle systems, include:<br>
<br>Reactor Pressure Control: The reactor/HP loop pressure (~150 bar) must be maintained to keep reaction equilibrium. A pressure controller (PIC) monitors reactor pressure and manipulates a downstream valve or vent. To avoid “snowball” effects in the recycle (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=not to manipulate an inlet,stream or a recycle/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=not to manipulate an inlet,stream or a recycle" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

Seborg, Thomas F. Edgar etc.) (Z-Library).pdf</a>), it is preferable to manipulate an exit stream rather than a feed. Thus, a small inert vent from the HP condenser is used: if pressure rises above setpoint, the vent valve opens slightly to release inert gases (and some NH₃/CO₂) to a scrubber, bringing pressure down. Major deviations are rare since feeds are mostly liquid, but this ensures safe pressure. The fresh feed flow controllers (for NH₃ pump and CO₂ compressor) typically run at set ratio (see below) and could trim flows for slow pressure control if needed (cascade from PIC to CO₂ feed if venting capacity is limited).<br>

<br>NH₃/CO₂ Feed Ratio Control: Maintaining the correct ammonia to carbon dioxide ratio (~3.4:1 molar) is critical for conversion and to avoid ammonium carbamate precipitation (if NH₃ too low) or excess free ammonia (if too high). A ratio controller is implemented: the NH₃ feed flow is controlled in cascade to a flow controller on the CO₂ feed or vice versa. For example, measure CO₂ feed flow (master) and adjust NH₃ feed to maintain the desired ratio (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=typical applications of ratio control,1) spec/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=typical applications of ratio control,1) spec" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

This ensures even if CO₂ feed fluctuates, ammonia feed follows proportionally, keeping the reactor inlet composition stable. Ratio control is a simple form of feedforward control that greatly stabilizes the key reactant proportion (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=15/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=15" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

Seborg, Thomas F. Edgar etc.) (Z-Library).pdf</a>).<br>

<br>Reactor Temperature Control: The reactor is mostly adiabatic, so temperature is a function of feed conditions and reaction extent. There is no direct jacket on the reactor in this design (unlike a catalytic reactor), but temperature can be indirectly controlled by adjusting the NH₃ recycle or feed temperature. For instance, the ammonia preheater bypass can be used: if reactor temperature is too low (perhaps due to less reaction heat), one can increase feed NH₃ temperature (within metallurgical limits) by routing more through the preheater. Conversely, if reactor temperature is trending high, slightly cooler feed helps absorb heat. This is a slow control loop. A more direct approach is to monitor reactor temperature and ensure it stays below ~190°C by adjusting the steam rate in the stripper (since the stripper reboiler duty can indirectly influence reactor temperature by shifting equilibrium). This leads to…<br>

<br>Stripper Heating Control (Cascade): The HP stripper duty is adjusted to maintain a target bottom temperature or urea concentration. A temperature controller on the stripper outlet (or a composition analyzer for urea in solution) manipulates the steam flow to the stripper reboiler. This is implemented as a cascade control: the master controller (urea concentration or bottom temp, TIC) sets the setpoint for a flow controller on steam (FIC). The flow controller then quickly adjusts the steam valve. This cascade improves response because the steam flow can be adjusted rapidly to disturbances, while the temperature loop takes care of the slower concentration dynamics (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=manipulated variable, the cooling water,makeup rate/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=manipulated variable, the cooling water,makeup rate" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

Seborg, Thomas F. Edgar etc.) (Z-Library).pdf</a>). The goal is to ensure consistent decomposition of carbamate so that the downstream load is steady. If the stripper temp rises too high, the TIC will cut back steam to avoid excessive stripping (which could overheat and also flood the condenser with too much gas).<br>

<br>Level Control (HP Loop): The high-pressure carbamate condenser/receiver has a liquid level (carbamate recycle). A level controller (LIC) here manipulates the recycle pump or a letdown valve to the MP section. Usually, the carbamate recycle pump draws off liquid at a fixed rate; if the level rises, a small amount of carbamate solution can be let down to the MP absorber suction (some designs include a letdown for excess). In Aspen, we ensure the recycle loop has a degree of freedom by specifying one stream flow via a design spec to maintain overall mass balance. Similarly, the stripper bottom level is controlled by the letdown valve to the MP decomposer (XV-1101). The LIC at the stripper opens/closes this valve to maintain level, thereby regulating the flow into the MP section (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=line 1217 to LP section,maintain level in MP decomposer" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=line%201217%20to%20LP%20section,maintain%20level%20in%20MP%20decomposer" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=,and subsequently through MP decomposer" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=,and%20subsequently%20through%20MP%20decomposer" target="_blank"></a>). This prevents carrying over gas into MP or starving it.<br>

<br>MP Absorber &amp; Recycle Controls: The medium-pressure absorber (carbamate separator column) has its own controls akin to a distillation column. We maintain the pressure at ~18 bar via a backpressure regulator on the vent to the LP scrubber. The reflux ratio (liquid NH₃ feed) is set so that essentially all CO₂ is absorbed. An overhead condenser may be present (cooler for the top), maintaining a temperature ~45°C; its duty could be adjusted to control overhead vapor temperature (which correlates with NH₃ slip). The bottom level of this column (carbamate solution) is controlled by the carbamate recycle pump flow – essentially pumping out at the rate that maintains level. A downstream flow controller on P-1201 ensures the exact required recycle rate (12 t/h or as needed). The pure ammonia that collects in the reflux drum (V-1201) is split: some is refluxed to the column, and excess is sent forward to the reactor feed. A level control on the reflux drum typically splits the flow: if the ammonia level rises, more ammonia is sent to the reactor feed. This effectively recycles unconverted ammonia.<br>

<br>Low-Pressure &amp; Vacuum Controls: The low-pressure decomposer has a pressure controller via a vacuum system or control valve maintaining ~4 bar. Steam flow to its reboiler is flow-controlled based on a temperature setpoint to get the desired urea concentration out. The vacuum evaporators operate under tight pressure control via vacuum pumps or steam ejectors; their condensate levels are controlled by condensate pumps. Each evaporator has a temperature control (via steam valve) to hit the target concentration. The final melt tank level is controlled by adjusting the prill tower feed pump speed (ensuring a steady feed to prilling). The prilling tower itself requires control of air flow (to maintain prill cooling rate) and sometimes melt spray rate (to control prill size). These are generally fixed once at steady state, but interlocks exist to shut off melt feed if the air flow fails (to avoid a heap of molten urea).<br>

<br>Safety Interlocks: Though not part of normal control, the high-pressure section has safety systems. High pressure or high temperature trips will shut feeds and vent to safeties. For example, if reactor pressure &gt; design, emergency relief to a scrubber activates. Toxic ammonia detectors around the prill tower or pumps can trigger alarms or water deluge. These aspects aren’t in the steady-state model but are considered in design.<br>

<br>Control Philosophy: Overall, the plant is run with the high-pressure loop self-regulating via recycle, and more active control on the downstream sections to handle the large swings in flow when feed or production rates change. The recycle loops can cause interaction and long process delays (known as recycle transients or “snowball” effects). The control strategy avoids manipulating recycle flow directly for control (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=not to manipulate an inlet,stream or a recycle/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=not to manipulate an inlet,stream or a recycle" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

Seborg, Thomas F. Edgar etc.) (Z-Library).pdf</a>); instead it manipulates utilities or purge streams to absorb disturbances. For example, if the urea production rate is to be increased, both NH₃ and CO₂ feed setpoints are ramped together (ratio kept constant) and the system gradually finds a new equilibrium; the stripper steam is increased to handle extra load, etc. Advanced strategies like feedforward control can be added: e.g., if CO₂ feed rate changes, proactively adjust stripper steam and absorber coolant to anticipate composition changes. Cascade control is applied where a secondary measurement can respond faster (steam flow, etc.) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=manipulated variable, the cooling water,makeup rate/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=manipulated variable, the cooling water,makeup rate" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

Critical measurements include reactor temperature, stripper bottom composition, and condensate quality (for environmental compliance).<br>From the process control literature, this approach of combining ratio control for feeds, cascade temperature control for critical exchangers, and inventory (level/pressure) control for each section is standard for complex chemical plants (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=this problem can be avoided,by manipulating a/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-atfcvu16fyg6rmabjapst1%23:~:text=this problem can be avoided,by manipulating a" target="_blank">Process Dynamics and Control (Dale E.

The Aspen model will implement these controls conceptually (through specifications or design specs) to ensure the steady-state solution respects operational constraints (e.g., the ratio spec ensures proper convergence of the recycle). By including these control considerations in the design phase, the process model reflects a realistic and operable plant, not just an ideal simulation.]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\process-control-strategy-for-stable-operation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Process Control Strategy for Stable Operation.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 02:11:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Process Units and Operating Conditions]]></title><description><![CDATA[

High-Pressure Synthesis Loop: The heart of the process is the high-pressure synthesis loop, which operates around ~150 bar and 185–190°C to maximize urea formation (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The increased residence time combined,with a titanium or zirconium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20increased%20residence%20time%20combined,with%20a%20titanium%20or%20zirconium" target="_blank"></a>). Key equipment and conditions are:<br>
<br>Ammonia Feed System (P-100 &amp; E-100): Liquid ammonia from storage (≈18 bar, 12°C) is pressurized in stages. A booster pump brings NH₃ to ~22 bar, then a high-pressure reciprocating pump raises it to ~240 bar (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=High" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=High" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=Carbon Dioxide Compression System" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=Carbon%20Dioxide%20Compression%20System" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>) to ensure ~150 bar at the reactor inlet (allowing for pressure drop). A pulsation damper is included to smooth flow. Ammonia is preheated to ~75°C before the reactor using recovered heat (e.g. from low-pressure condenser vapors) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=suction of the second pump" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=suction%20of%20the%20second%20pump" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>). The fresh NH₃ feed rate (after recycle makeup) is ~69 t/hr as noted.<br>

<br>CO₂ Feed Compressor (C-101): Gaseous CO₂ (e.g. from an ammonia plant’s reformer) at ~1.5 bar, 40°C is compressed in a multi-stage compressor with intercooling (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=Carbon Dioxide Compression System" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=Carbon%20Dioxide%20Compression%20System" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>). The discharge is ~150–160 bar, ~40°C. The CO₂ feed (≈83 t/hr fresh) is introduced to the high-pressure stripper (described below) rather than directly to the reactor in this ammonia-stripping configuration. Compressed CO₂ may be slightly preheated or fed as is, depending on the design.<br>

<br>High-Pressure Reactor (R-101): A vertical, multi-tray reactor (approximately 25–30 m tall) where NH₃ and CO₂ react to form urea. Operating conditions are ~150 bar and 185–190°C (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The increased residence time combined,with a titanium or zirconium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20increased%20residence%20time%20combined,with%20a%20titanium%20or%20zirconium" target="_blank"></a>), with an NH₃:CO₂ molar ratio ~3.4:1 maintained by excess ammonia (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The increased residence time combined,with a titanium or zirconium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20increased%20residence%20time%20combined,with%20a%20titanium%20or%20zirconium" target="_blank"></a>). Under these conditions, about 62–65% of the CO₂ is converted to urea per pass (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=The Snamprogetti process operates with,65% in the reactor" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=The%20Snamprogetti%20process%20operates%20with,65%25%20in%20the%20reactor" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>) (the remainder forms ammonium carbamate or remains unreacted). The reactor trays (e.g. “supercup” trays) enhance mixing and residence time, effectively creating a series of small CSTR zones to approach equilibrium (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure 6 also illustrates the,high operating temperature of 188°C" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure%206%20also%20illustrates%20the,high%20operating%20temperature%20of%20188%C2%B0C" target="_blank"></a>). Residence time is designed &gt;25 minutes, which is sufficient for the slow carbamate dehydration reaction to approach equilibrium (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=and takes around 20 minutes,Higher residence time favors equilibrium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=and%20takes%20around%2020%20minutes,Higher%20residence%20time%20favors%20equilibrium" target="_blank"></a>). The reactor effluent is a liquid solution of ~34–40 wt% urea in a mixture of ammonium carbamate, unconverted NH₃, CO₂, and water (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=lining,The impurities are removed by" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=lining,The%20impurities%20are%20removed%20by" target="_blank"></a>). A small vapor phase (mostly NH₃ and CO₂) may be present at the top. The reactor is typically operated adiabatically or with minimal cooling; the heat of carbamate formation raises the temperature to the equilibrium level (~188°C). High-grade stainless steel (25-22-2 CrNiMo) with titanium/zirconium lining is used due to the corrosive carbamate environment (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=pressure of 150 bar and,is led to the stripper" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=pressure%20of%20150%20bar%20and,is%20led%20to%20the%20stripper" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=3,the excess carbamate%2C ammonia and" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=3,the%20excess%20carbamate%2C%20ammonia%20and" target="_blank"></a>).<br>

<br>High-Pressure Stripper (E-102): The hot reactor effluent flows to a falling-film carbamate stripper operating at the same high pressure (~150 bar) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=CO2,the stripper to prevent gas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=CO2,the%20stripper%20to%20prevent%20gas" target="_blank"></a>). The stripper is a vertical heat exchanger (often with titanium tubes) where medium-pressure steam (e.g. 4–7 bar steam) is fed to the shell to heat the urea solution to ~200–205°C (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=medium pressure decomposer,ensure corrosion and erosion of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=medium%20pressure%20decomposer,ensure%20corrosion%20and%20erosion%20of" target="_blank"></a>). This endothermic heating decomposes a large portion of ammonium carbamate back to NH₃ and CO₂, which bubbles out and strips additional NH₃/CO₂ from the descending liquid (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=adding medium pressure steam to,150 bar and temperatures up" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=adding%20medium%20pressure%20steam%20to,150%20bar%20and%20temperatures%20up" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=ammonium carbamate,significantly reduced the lifespan of" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=ammonium%20carbamate,significantly%20reduced%20the%20lifespan%20of" target="_blank"></a>). In the Snamprogetti process, the stripping agent is predominantly the excess NH₃ vapor generated by heating, as well as the CO₂ feed itself (introduced at the bottom of the stripper) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=The Snamprogetti Urea Process is,to the reactor%2C where it's" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=The%20Snamprogetti%20Urea%20Process%20is,to%20the%20reactor%2C%20where%20it%27s" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=ammonia as a self,into urea%2C completing the cycle" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=ammonia%20as%20a%20self,into%20urea%2C%20completing%20the%20cycle" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>).

<br>High-Pressure Carbamate Condenser (E-101): The NH₃ and CO₂ vapors leaving the stripper (along with any carryover water or urea vapor) flow to the HP carbamate condenser operating at 150 bar. Here, they are cooled (to ~170°C) and condensed to ammonium carbamate by an external coolant or generating steam. Snamprogetti designs often use the heat of condensation (highly exothermic reaction NH₃+CO₂→carbamate) to produce low-pressure steam (~4–5 bar, ~147°C) for use elsewhere (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The increased residence time combined,with a titanium or zirconium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20increased%20residence%20time%20combined,with%20a%20titanium%20or%20zirconium" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=CO2,the stripper to prevent gas" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=CO2,the%20stripper%20to%20prevent%20gas" target="_blank"></a>). The condenser can be a submerged tube or kettle type exchanger with cooling water on tubes and carbamate forming in the shell. The product is a liquid carbamate solution which is recycled. A small gas exit from the condenser goes to an Inert Gas Separator, where inert gases (and traces of NH₃/CO₂) are removed and sent to a scrubber to prevent accumulation. The condensed carbamate (and dissolved ammonia) flow to a High-Pressure Carbamate Receiver (separator vessel) and then are pumped by a high-pressure recycle pump (P-101) back into the reactor, completing the HP loop (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=integration,into urea%2C completing the cycle" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=integration,into%20urea%2C%20completing%20the%20cycle" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=The Snamprogetti stripping process yields,intensive pumping" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=The%20Snamprogetti%20stripping%20process%20yields,intensive%20pumping" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>).

<br>2. Medium-Pressure Recovery Section: After the HP stripper, the urea-rich solution (42–45% urea, with ~55% water and residual NH₃/carbamate) is let down to medium pressure for further purification:<br>
<br>Medium-Pressure Decomposer (C-1101): The solution from the HP stripper is expanded to ~18 bar (via a letdown valve) and fed to the medium-pressure decomposer, which operates at 18 bar and up to ~205°C (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure 10%3A diagram of MP,decomposers from the high corrosion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure%2010%3A%20diagram%20of%20MP,decomposers%20from%20the%20high%20corrosion" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The 42 wt,is fed into the top" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%2042%20wt,is%20fed%20into%20the%20top" target="_blank"></a>).

Upon flashing to 18 bar, some free NH₃ and CO₂ come out of solution immediately (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The 42 wt,is fed into the top" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%2042%20wt,is%20fed%20into%20the%20top" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=decomposer is to concentrate the,the falling film type heat" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=decomposer%20is%20to%20concentrate%20the,the%20falling%20film%20type%20heat" target="_blank"></a>). The remaining liquid flows downward over heated tubes (with 18-bar steam on the shell side) and packing inserts that promote plug flow. Residual ammonium carbamate in solution decomposes to NH₃ and CO₂ (endothermic) as the liquid is heated (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=bar through an expansion valve%2C,rest of the solution passes" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=bar%20through%20an%20expansion%20valve%2C,rest%20of%20the%20solution%20passes" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=exchanger middle section,coming from the HP carbamate" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=exchanger%20middle%20section,coming%20from%20the%20HP%20carbamate" target="_blank"></a>). These released gases strip additional volatile components from the liquid. The MP decomposer raises the urea concentration from ~42% to about 62 wt% urea (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The 42 wt,is fed into the top" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%2042%20wt,is%20fed%20into%20the%20top" target="_blank"></a>) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=decomposer is to concentrate the,the falling film type heat" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=decomposer%20is%20to%20concentrate%20the,the%20falling%20film%20type%20heat" target="_blank"></a>). The top section (flash separator) ensures no excessive liquid carryover to downstream by maintaining a liquid level (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Urea Production and Purification (CHBOST,diagram of MP decomposer 13" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Urea%20Production%20and%20Purification%20%28CHBOST,diagram%20of%20MP%20decomposer%2013" target="_blank"></a>). Care is taken to limit liquid residence time at high temperature to avoid biuret formation (two urea molecules condensing to biuret) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure 11%3A Transport of a,the unwanted side product%2C biuret" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure%2011%3A%20Transport%20of%20a,the%20unwanted%20side%20product%2C%20biuret" target="_blank"></a>). The MP decomposer is constructed from high-alloy stainless steel (25-22-2 CrNiMo) to resist corrosion at 18 bar, 210°C (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure 10%3A diagram of MP,decomposers from the high corrosion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=Figure%2010%3A%20diagram%20of%20MP,decomposers%20from%20the%20high%20corrosion" target="_blank"></a>). The vapor stream from the MP decomposer (mostly NH₃, CO₂, and some H₂O) exits the top. The liquid bottom product (62% urea, rest water) is let down to the low-pressure section for final purification.<br>

<br>Medium-Pressure Condenser &amp; Carbamate Absorber (C-1202 system): The mixed vapor from the MP decomposer contains NH₃, CO₂, and water, and is at 18 bar. It is first used to recover heat: these vapors are fed to the shell side of a preheater in the downstream vacuum section (heat integration to save steam) where they partially condense by heating cold urea solution. After cooling/partial condensation, the stream enters the MP Carbamate Condenser where it is further cooled to ~75°C. Here, most of the NH₃ and CO₂ condense (react) with a carbamate-rich solution to form ammonium carbamate. The two-phase mixture then goes to the Ammonia–Carbamate Separation Column (MP absorber), a bubble-cap column at ~18 bar. This column has multiple feeds: the condensed carbamate solution (from the MP condenser) enters near the column bottom; a reflux of cool liquid ammonia (from an ammonia recovery drum) enters at the top; and a stream of water-rich process condensate enters upper trays (from a downstream scrubber). In this column, remaining free gases (NH₃, CO₂, inerts) rise and meet down-flowing liquid ammonia and water. NH₃ and CO₂ are absorbed and react to form carbamate in the liquid, while inerts and a small residual of NH₃ exit the top to a vent scrubber. The bottom of this MP absorber column produces a concentrated ammonium carbamate solution, which is collected in a carbamate receiver (V-1201). A centrifugal carbamate recycle pump (P-1201) then pumps this carbamate solution (≈12 t/hr) back up to the high-pressure condenser, allowing the recovered NH₃/CO₂ to re-enter the HP loop. A portion of nearly pure liquid ammonia from the carbamate separator is also recycled to the reactor feed (the column overhead ammonia goes to the reflux drum). The MP recovery section thus minimizes chemical losses by recovering NH₃ and CO₂ as reusable streams, at the cost of some additional equipment and cooling duty. Operating temperature in the absorber is 45–75°C to ensure absorption without solid carbamate crystallization. Pressure is maintained at ~18 bar with a control valve leading to the low-pressure scrubber.<br>

<br>3. Low-Pressure Purification and Evaporation: After the MP decomposer, the urea solution (~62% urea, balance water with traces of NH₃) is further concentrated to produce molten urea. This occurs in two steps: a low-pressure decomposer and vacuum evaporation.<br>
<br>Low-Pressure Decomposer (C-1301): The 62% urea solution is expanded to a low pressure, typically ~3–5 bar, and fed to the LP decomposer (also called low-pressure carbamate hydrolyzer). This unit is similar to the MP decomposer: a heated falling-film or tray column that decomposes remaining carbamate at ~120–140°C. Any residual ammonium carbamate or dissolved NH₃ is stripped out by the slight heating and pressure reduction (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The LP section is the,in the low pressure decomposer" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20LP%20section%20is%20the,in%20the%20low%20pressure%20decomposer" target="_blank"></a>). The vapor (low-pressure NH₃, CO₂, and H₂O) from this step is cooled in the LP Carbamate Condenser (if present) and then sent to the MP absorber or to a dedicated LP vent scrubber. The liquid leaving the LP decomposer is now mostly urea and water (e.g. ~80–85% urea). This flows to the vacuum concentrators.<br>

<br>Vacuum Evaporation and Prilling Feed: To achieve high-purity solid urea, the solution is vacuum concentrated. Two vacuum evaporators in series (often called preconcentrator and concentrator) operate at 0.2–0.4 bar and 0.03–0.06 bar respectively (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=,ammonia stripping in urea production" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://enggyd.blogspot.com/2010/09/snamprogetti-urea-process-description.html#:~:text=,ammonia%20stripping%20in%20urea%20production" target="_blank">Engineers Guide: The Snamprogetti Urea Process Description</a>). Heat is provided by steam in each stage (or by hot water in the second stage) to boil off water (and last traces of NH₃/CO₂). The first vacuum evaporator (Preconcentrator) might operate around 0.3–0.4 bar, 130°C, yielding ~95% urea melt, and the second (Concentrator) at ~0.03 bar, ~135°C, to reach 99.6 wt% molten urea. The vapor from these evaporators (water with a small amount of ammonia/urea) is condensed and sent to a process condensate treatment section. The molten urea (with &lt;0.4% water/impurities) is collected in a melt tank and continuously fed to the finishing unit.<br>

<br>Prilling Tower (T-1501): The high-purity molten urea (≈133–140°C) is fed to a prilling system to produce solid fertilizer prills. In a prilling tower, the melt is sprayed or dropped from the top through nozzles, forming droplets that solidify as they fall counter-currently through a rising stream of cool air. The tower is a large structure (50–100 m tall) with an air blower providing ambient air from bottom. Solid spherical prills 1–3 mm form by the time they reach the bottom collection hopper at ~40°C. The prills are then screened and sent to storage. Off-gases from the prilling tower (air containing residual ammonia or urea dust) are scrubbed with water or acid to meet environmental emission standards (typically &lt;50 mg/Nm³ NH₃).<br>

<br>Wastewater Treatment: Various condensate streams (from the vacuum evaporators, MP/LP condensers, and prilling scrubber) containing dissolved ammonia, CO₂, and urea are sent to a hydrolyzer and distillation unit. In the hydrolyzer (operating ~0.3–0.5 MPa, 180°C), urea in the water is hydrolyzed back to NH₃ and CO₂ using steam, and these gases are recycled or used as fuel. The effluent is then stripped of ammonia, producing clean process water. This ensures &lt;10 ppm urea in the discharged water (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=was identified that 6.8 wt,to comply with emission regulations" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/15512/1/CE_BC_2016_UreaGroupReport.pdf#:~:text=was%20identified%20that%206.8%20wt,to%20comply%20with%20emission%20regulations" target="_blank"></a>) to comply with environmental regulations. The recovered NH₃/CO₂ are recycled to the low-pressure absorber or disposed safely.<br>

This is a fast, strongly exothermic reaction. It runs practically to completion if the reaction heat is removed and the pressure is high enough to force the NH3 and CO2 into the liquid phase.

Slow and slightly endothermic. The reaction only runs in the liquid phase, and there is no known catalyst to speed it up.

Although the properties of biuret and urea are in many respects quite similar, in most applications of urea biuret is considered to be an unwanted contaminant. It can be suppressed by:

<br>restricting residence time and temperature
<br>maintaining an excess of ammonia, forcing the reaction to the urea side

<br>Ammonium Carbamate Formation: 2 NH₃ (g or l) + CO₂ (g) ↔ NH₂COONH₄ (carbamate)<br>
– This reaction is fast and exothermic, reaching equilibrium almost instantaneously under reactor conditions (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=literature range/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=literature range" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>). At 150 bar and ~180°C, the conversion of CO₂ to ammonium carbamate is very high (&gt;&gt;90%) unless temperature is too high. However, at higher temperatures the equilibrium shifts backward (Le Châtelier’s principle for exothermic reaction) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=ammonium carbamate ,two reactions must be determined/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=ammonium carbamate ,two reactions must be determined" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>).
<br>Carbamate Dehydration to Urea: NH₂COONH₄ (aq) ↔ NH₂CONH₂ (urea) + H₂O<br>
– This second step is endothermic and slower, and it is the rate-limiting step for urea formation. Higher temperature favors this dehydration (since it is endothermic) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=,two reactions must be determined/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=,two reactions must be determined" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>), but too high a temperature will reduce the carbamate formation from step 1.

<br>In Aspen Plus, these reactions are defined in the reactor block. Reaction (1) (carbamate formation) can be modeled as an equilibrium reaction because of its fast kinetics – i.e. the reactor can assume reaction (1) reaches equilibrium at the operating conditions. Reaction (2) (urea formation) can be modeled either via equilibrium with a specified equilibrium constant or via kinetic rate expressions. We incorporate literature equilibrium data: for example, the equilibrium constant  for the carbamate formation has been correlated as  (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://xn--file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=,6569  103-c2d/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\xn--file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=,6569  103-c2d" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>), and achieves ~70% conversion at 450 K (177°C) and 250 atm with 3:1 NH₃:CO₂ (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=from literature, common reported yields,7, and a/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=from literature, common reported yields,7, and a" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>). Kinetic data for the dehydration reaction can also be used. The urea formation rate has been studied; a residence around 20 minutes is needed to approach equilibrium at 180°C (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=and takes around 20 minutes,Higher residence time favors equilibrium" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=and%20takes%20around%2020%20minutes,Higher%20residence%20time%20favors%20equilibrium" target="_blank"></a>). In this model, we will implement Reaction (2) with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression fitted from literature, or as a user-defined kinetics subroutine, to ensure proper rate behavior. The kinetics will be tuned so that at 25 min and ~188°C, ~65% conversion is achieved (matching known plant performance).<br>Thermodynamic Model: The NH₃–CO₂–H₂O–urea system is highly non-ideal, with a combination of polar components, chemical reaction, and potential ionic dissociation (ammonium carbamate in aqueous solution). For the high-pressure synthesis where little water is present and components are mostly molecular, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation-of-state with appropriate binary interaction parameters is chosen (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=temperature and high pressure operating,define vapor and liquid phases" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=temperature%20and%20high%20pressure%20operating,define%20vapor%20and%20liquid%20phases" target="_blank"></a>). SRK can reasonably represent vapor–liquid equilibria at high T/P for the ammonia–carbon dioxide system (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=steady,pressure conditions.

Aspen’s built-in Electrolyte NRTL model could be employed for the lower-pressure sections where aqueous behavior and dissociation of ammonia/carbon dioxide (forming ammonium, carbonate ions) occur; however, many simulations (and literature studies) successfully use a single EOS like SRK for the entire flowsheet for simplicity (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=process was simulated in ChemCAD,Also%2C stoichiometric reactors" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=process%20was%20simulated%20in%20ChemCAD,Also%2C%20stoichiometric%20reactors" target="_blank"></a>). In this model, we will treat ammonium carbamate as a distinct pseudo-component (NH₂COONH₄) and include it in the component list (as needed, using Aspen’s INFAC or user-defined component capability) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=temperature and high,addressed here hence provides an" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I484.pdf#:~:text=temperature%20and%20high,addressed%20here%20hence%20provides%20an" target="_blank"></a>). Alternatively, the reactions can be explicitly equilibrated without a defined carbamate species by using reaction equilibrium constants in the reactor. Physical property data (heat capacities, etc.) for urea and carbamate will be loaded from Aspen’s databank or literature.<br>Vapor–liquid equilibrium is critical to accurately simulate the recovery sections (stripper, decomposers, absorbers). The model uses Henry’s Law for CO₂ and NH₃ in the liquid where applicable and includes exothermic heats of solution/reaction. For example, the carbamate condenser is modeled with an Aspen RGibbs or REquil reactor to enforce simultaneous condensation and reaction to carbamate at 150 bar, releasing heat. The SRK EOS with Henry-components for NH₃/CO₂ in water could be applied to capture the partial pressures in the low-pressure absorber. Wherever needed, we adjust binary interaction parameters (BIPs) to match known phase equilibrium data (e.g. NH₃–H₂O, CO₂–H₂O systems). The thermodynamic framework will be validated by checking that the model reproduces known benchmarks: e.g. ~150 bar reactor vapor composition (very small, a few percent of total) and the boiling points in the strippers (205°C at 150 bar, etc.). Aspen’s physical property analysis tools will be used to ensure no phase stability issues (like carbamate precipitation) occur in the simulation range.<br>Reaction Equilibrium and Kinetics Data: We incorporate the following data into Aspen Plus:<br>
<br>Equilibrium Constants: The equilibrium constant for urea formation (Reaction 2) as a function of temperature, often given in literature (e.g. by Nielsen or other researchers). If available, Aspen’s REACTION data can be filled with  for both reactions. If not, Reaction 1 can be given an artificially high rate (to enforce near-equilibrium) and Reaction 2 a kinetic rate plus a reverse reaction tuned to equilibrium constant.<br>

<br>Kinetic Rate: For reaction 2, a representative Arrhenius form: . Some sources suggest a second-order dependence on carbamate concentration for the dehydration. The model can use a simplifying assumption of first-order in carbamate for demonstration, adjusting  so that at 188°C, 20 min gives ~50–60% conversion. The exact kinetics may be less critical if we calibrate to the known conversion; however, including it allows exploration of deviations (e.g. if temperature drops, conversion will drop per kinetics).<br>

<br>Side Reactions: We include the biuret formation reaction: 2 NH₂CONH₂ → NH₂CONHCONH₂ + NH₃. This undesired reaction occurs at high temperature and long residence. We will track it with an equilibrium or kinetic expression (favored at low water, high T). In the model, we can allow a small fraction (e.g. 0.3–0.5% of urea) to convert to biuret in the evaporators. This ensures the final product quality has &lt;1% biuret, as required for fertilizer grade. Any free ammonia from biuret formation is recycled.<br>

<br>Overall, the Aspen Plus reactor (R-101) will likely be modeled as an RPlug (plug flow reactor) with multiple segments or as a series of CSTR blocks to approximate the tray-by-tray reaction progression (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="file://file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=match at l617 multiple cstrs,different stages of the reactor/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="file:\\file-e8dkkf9sulctvjksb4st4v%23:~:text=match at l617 multiple cstrs,different stages of the reactor" target="_blank">Urea51_Thermodynamics and Kinetics_SupplementalReport.pdf</a>). This allows applying different extents of equilibrium at different points (since the reactor trays act somewhat like small equilibrium stages). The stripper and decomposers are modeled as Heater + Flash/Separator units where we impose the temperature and phase split. For example, the HP stripper can be modeled by a Heater block (bringing the liquid from 188°C to ~203°C) followed by a Flash2 separator at 150 bar to separate vapor (NH₃, CO₂) and liquid (urea-rich). We may also use an REquil block for the stripper to simultaneously compute carbamate decomposition equilibrium at 150 bar, 205°C, which would inherently give the vapor composition. The MP and LP decomposers can be treated similarly (Heater + Flash at 18 bar and 4 bar respectively, or short equilibrium reactors). The MP absorber and LP scrubber are best modeled with RadFrac distillation columns (with total condenser and partial reboiler turned off as needed) to rigorously compute the staged absorption of NH₃ and CO₂ into liquid. For simplification, one can model the MP absorber as an absorber column (absorption mode in RadFrac) with specified number of stages, using NH₃ feed as reflux and carbamate solution out the bottom. These details ensure that reaction thermodynamics and phase behavior are accurately captured, which is essential for a stable simulation of the recycle loops.]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\reaction-chemistry,-kinetics,-and-thermodynamics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Reaction Chemistry, Kinetics, and Thermodynamics.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:49:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Report and Presentations Booklet]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The following sensitivities were examined:<br>
<br>Urea Selling Price: Profitability is highly sensitive to urea market price. At the base $300/ton, IRR ~22%. If price drops to $250/ton (a 17% decrease), the IRR falls to ~12% and NPV may approach zero, indicating the project is marginal at that price. Conversely, at $350/ton, IRR could exceed 30%. The break-even price (NPV=0 over 20 years at 10% discount) was found to be around $~180–$200/ton urea, meaning the project remains viable as long as prices stay above that (which is expected under most forecasts) (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/52041/52041-003-tacr-en.pdf#:~:text=annual estimated production is 0,of %24330 per ton" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/52041/52041-003-tacr-en.pdf#:~:text=annual%20estimated%20production%20is%200,of%20%24330%20per%20ton" target="_blank">[PDF] Prefeasibility Analysis for Carbon Capture, Util</a>).<br>

<br>Natural Gas (Ammonia Feedstock) Price: For an integrated plant, gas price has a large impact on operating cost. We tested $3/MMBtu vs $8/MMBtu (base $5). At $8, the ammonia production cost increases significantly, raising urea cash cost by about $60/ton and reducing IRR by ~5 percentage points. The project is still profitable at high gas prices if urea prices rise accordingly (often fertilizer prices correlate with gas). Alternatively, if ammonia were purchased and its price spiked similarly, impacts are comparable.<br>

<br>Plant Capacity Utilization: The economics assume near full capacity (90+% uptime). If utilization dropped (say due to operational issues or market curtailment) to 70%, the fixed costs per ton increase and the IRR drops. Our analysis shows at 70% capacity, the IRR could fall below 10%, emphasizing the need for reliable operation and consistent demand. This underscores the importance of the robust design and control strategy for on-stream reliability (targeting &gt;330 days/year uptime).<br>

<br>Reaction Conversion Efficiency: We varied the single-pass conversion in the model (by adjusting NH₃:CO₂ ratio and reactor residence). If conversion per pass were only 50% instead of 65%, the recycle flows would increase dramatically. The HP condenser and stripper duties would increase ~30%, and the MP absorber would need to handle ~double the load. This would likely require upsizing equipment and increase energy use by ~15%. Economically, more steam and power means operating cost +$10/ton. Thus, achieving the high conversion in the reactor is important. Fortunately, the design parameters (3.4:1 ratio, 25 min residence) comfortably achieve this; the sensitivity just illustrates the penalty of deviating from optimal conditions (e.g. if trays in reactor foul or NH₃ ratio not maintained).<br>

<br>Steam Consumption vs. Efficiency Projects: We analyzed the effect of implementing additional energy-saving projects, like a heat pump for the vacuum vapor or using the CO₂ compressor intercooler heat to preheat boiler feedwater. Reducing steam usage by 10% saved about $5/ton in utilities. While not game-changing for IRR, it improves environmental footprint and operating margin. Each GJ of steam saved per ton urea avoids ~50 kg CO₂ (if steam from fossil fuel). So incremental improvements contribute to sustainability goals.<br>

<br>Environmental Compliance Costs: We also considered the impact of stricter emissions requirements. For instance, if regulations required zero wastewater discharge, we might need to add a distillation/evaporation unit to completely close the loop, or treat water further at extra cost. If an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) was needed on prill tower off-gas to reduce NOx (not typically an issue for urea, but if firing a heater), that would be an extra capital. These costs were small relative to the plant cost (&lt;$10 million) and had negligible NPV impact, but are considered. If a carbon tax of $50/ton CO₂ were imposed on any emissions, our integrated plant would only be taxed on CO₂ eventually released from sold urea (0.73 ton CO₂/ton urea at end use). If counted, that tax would be $36.5/ton urea, possibly offset by the fact that this CO₂ was originally captured from natural gas production. This is a policy-dependent factor; sensitivity shows it could cut project NPV by ~30% if applied, highlighting the incentive to pursue carbon capture or product use that sequesters carbon (e.g., use urea in resins or other long-lived products).<br>

<br>The sensitivity analyses indicate that the project is most sensitive to product price and feedstock cost – typical for commodity chemicals. The process itself is relatively flexible: it can handle some fluctuations in feed ratio or conditions with the designed control system. The Aspen model helps quantify these effects: for example, a run at lower NH₃ ratio showed increased stripper duty and a bottleneck, informing that maintaining ratio is critical – which justifies the robust ratio control scheme. A summary of the economic sensitivity is in Table 4 (showing IRR variation):<br><br>Table 4: Indicative IRR sensitivity to key variables (others held at base).<br>This analysis confirms the design is economically sound within a reasonable range of scenarios. In Aspen Plus, such sensitivity analyses were facilitated by the sensitivity tool, varying one input at a time and recording results like energy use and flows, which we translated into economic outcomes.]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\sensitivity-analysis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/Sensitivity Analysis.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 02:23:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Separations]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Chemically, here’s what happens:<br>
<br>Reaction Background:<br>
In the urea synthesis reactor, ammonia and carbon dioxide react in two steps:
<br>
<br>First, (formation of ammonium carbamate) <img alt="" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeUc67reH5-TvvCapwELImTc1qptmx-R49klWj3j4YM6e_TfvD_rJOh8HQtsMIZ-9R8C0EWNAA14FvIZBXD2CsubMI_AC0vTH_qbmtEfh-LC_jeQJSvt3YbIPfTBCtwXZUZqJF6?key=ybZ0opu8f03KaSbFg4wKx-FQ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<br>Second, (dehydration to urea)
<br><img alt="" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfuky7HhPjza6E3L1Sy_Cl7jekj_5VJZATwc50ZocYYwnoificJlawnwFWE9MNeFJxp8QIck6ZDxKhva5W4_I3MUlePyq5Xd7aallPGADm3p4mTERkhXTYUuQzlrBwjp69rEEMoYw?key=ybZ0opu8f03KaSbFg4wKx-FQ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br>However, neither step goes to full completion under synthesis conditions. As a result, the reactor effluent is a mixture of urea, unconverted ammonium carbamate, free ammonia, and some water.  <br>
<br>Purpose of Stripping:<br>
The goal of the high‐pressure stripper is to drive the equilibrium further toward urea formation by removing the volatile species from the liquid. According to Le Chatelier’s principle, if you reduce the partial pressure of ammonia (which appears squared in the equilibrium expression), the decomposition of ammonium carbamate is further promoted:<br>
<img alt="" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcg9w2mQFq8BMTByd3WGIUrVntKeU9VNOfvK1MouMOZozwPemFrkJpD61YZiD_b_6UrbOA4DBLhV8i5V2T1jbwM_AO3jjSbljskwdIPHrR4VhPL04-sbr636mu_JQ-1fcSSqLPS?key=ybZ0opu8f03KaSbFg4wKx-FQ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;">      
<br>&nbsp;The equilibrium for the overall system can be roughly expressed as:<br>
<img alt="" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdB0Ug6HY1YHfRIfpIFa-aKVDeNhOVNts4xNZ91GjnM64iIqi9OiJmrT4PYpsMizfWfC5CDxMCN99TALpU6CJ6PLex_KdpT3BAvIxDeXRBSXYeRaRP0LchwSmJkqmJsfoy2xv25WQ?key=ybZ0opu8f03KaSbFg4wKx-FQ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" style="width: 196px; max-width: 100%;"><br>where lowering pNH3 drives the reaction to produce more gaseous ammonia (and hence decompose carbamate).<br>
<br>Self-Stripping Mechanism:<br>
In many modern urea plants (like those using the Snamprogetti process), the stripper operates as a “self‐stripper.” Instead of adding an external stripping gas (like CO₂), the process relies on the excess ammonia already present. As the urea/carbamate mixture is heated (typically by steam in the shell side of a falling-film tube heat exchanger), the ammonium carbamate decomposes further, generating more ammonia and CO₂. Because these gases are continuously removed by the upward flow through the tubes, the partial pressure of ammonia in the liquid is kept low. This removal – the “stripping” – is achieved by the physical entrainment of the vapors (generated in situ) with the gas phase.  
<br>Detailed Chemical Picture:
<br>
<br>
Heat and Mass Transfer: The falling film of urea/carbamate solution on the heated tubes is very thin, which ensures excellent heat transfer. The supplied heat (usually via high-pressure steam) raises the film’s temperature, making the ammonium carbamate unstable and prompting its decomposition.

<br>
Vapor Removal: As the ammonium carbamate decomposes, the generated ammonia (and accompanying CO₂) immediately transfers into the vapor phase. In a self-stripping design, this vapor is simply the gas phase already present in the reactor effluent – there is no need for an externally added gas stream.

<br>
Equilibrium Shift: With the continuous removal of ammonia (which appears squared in the equilibrium expression), the reaction is driven to decompose more carbamate. In effect, the free ammonia that is already present functions as its own “stripping agent,” maintaining a low over the liquid.

<br>
Resulting Composition: The liquid leaving the stripper, therefore, has a lower concentration of free ammonia and unconverted ammonium carbamate, meaning it is more concentrated in urea. The overhead vapor, which is condensed in the carbamate condenser, contains the stripped ammonia and CO₂ that are then recycled back to the reactor.

<br>
<br>Textbook Definition per CJ King Separation Processes (seps book):<br>
Per the textbook, a stripping agent is defined as the fluid introduced (or generated in situ) to lower the partial pressure of one or more volatile components in a liquid mixture—thus shifting the reaction equilibrium. In our high-pressure stripper, the self-stripping arrangement relies on the free ammonia (and its associated CO₂) produced during the thermal decomposition of ammonium carbamate. This contrasts with a CO₂ stripper where CO₂ would be externally fed. The advantage of the self-stripping design is that it makes use of the inherent excess ammonia, thereby simplifying the recycle loop and minimizing water carryover, which can otherwise impair urea conversion. 
<br><br>In summary:<br>
Chemically, the high-pressure stripper works by heating the urea/carbamate mixture (using steam) so that ammonium carbamate decomposes into gaseous ammonia and CO₂. In the self-stripping configuration common to the Snamprogetti process, the free ammonia generated acts as its own stripping agent by being entrained in the vapor phase. This continuous removal lowers the partial pressure of ammonia over the liquid, driving further decomposition of carbamate and shifting the equilibrium toward a more urea-rich liquid.<br>References:<br>
(EP 3 569 305 A1 – High Pressure Stripper Patent)<br>
(Meessen, Jozef, Urea Synthesis Process Description)<br>In our process—specifically in the high‐pressure stripper—a thermal decomposition reaction occurs. Here's what happens in chemical detail:<br>
<br>The reactor effluent is a urea/carbamate mixture that contains urea, unconverted ammonium carbamate, free ammonia, and water.  
<br>When this mixture is heated in the stripper (typically by steam in a falling-film heat exchanger), the ammonium carbamate undergoes further decomposition according to the reaction:<br>
NH2COONH4 (l)→NH3 (g)+CO2 (g)\mathrm{NH_2COONH_4\ (l) \rightarrow NH_3\ (g) + CO_2\ (g)}<br>

<br>This decomposition is endothermic; therefore, the stripper must supply enough heat to drive the reaction.<br>

<br>As ammonia and carbon dioxide are generated, they are immediately entrained in the vapor phase. In a self‐stripping design, the excess ammonia produced in the reactor (or from this very decomposition) acts as the stripping agent. This lowers the partial pressure of ammonia over the liquid, which according to Le Chatelier’s principle drives even more decomposition of carbamate.<br>

<br>The removed vapor—rich in NH₃ and CO₂—is then condensed (in a carbamate condenser) and recycled back to the reactor, while the liquid exiting the stripper becomes more concentrated in urea.

It features a high-pressure synthesis loop yielding 99.6% purity molten urea, with effective recycling to optimize CO₂ conversion.<br><br>Title
The processing units include the High-Pressure Reactor (operating at ~150 bar and 185–190°C), Medium-Pressure Decomposer (~18 bar, up to ~205°C), and Low-Pressure Decomposer (3–5 bar, 120–140°C). These conditions maximize urea production efficiency. 
<br><br>Table 2: Major equipment and operating conditions for the Snamprogetti urea process (design basis).<br><br>The text discusses urea synthesis, involving a two-step process: fast, exothermic ammonium carbamate formation, and slower, endothermic urea formation. Optimal conditions for high conversion (60-65% at ~185°C) are crucial, while modeling in Aspen Plus accounts for kinetics and thermodynamics to ensure accurate simulations.<br><br>The text outlines control strategies for a urea plant, emphasizing NH₃/CO₂ feed ratio management, reactor temperature control, and stripper heating. It highlights the use of cascade controls and safety interlocks to maintain efficiency and stability in high-pressure systems, while addressing fluctuations in feed rates with proactive strategies.<br><br>A preliminary economic analysis of a 1.0 MMTPY urea plant estimates capital costs between $300-$400 million, with an integrated ammonia unit increasing total costs to over $1 billion. The project shows a potential IRR of 20-30% and strong profitability metrics, indicating economic feasibility with a payback period of 4-5 years.<br><br>The text discusses a urea production process that optimizes heat recovery, steam usage, and reaction conditions to enhance energy efficiency and reduce CO₂ emissions. It highlights the near-zero direct emissions from utilizing feed CO₂ in urea synthesis and emphasizes the importance of ammonia sourcing for indirect emissions.<br><br>The project’s robustness was assessed through sensitivity analyses, revealing that profitability is highly dependent on urea prices, gas costs, and plant capacity utilization. At $300/ton urea, IRR is 22%, but drops significantly with lower prices or reduced capacity. Maintaining high reaction conversion efficiency is crucial for cost-effectiveness and operational reliability.<br>]]></description><link>coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\urea-51-project-overview.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Coursework/Year 4/Semester 2/ENCH 446 Process Econ &amp; Design II/UREA 51 Project Overview.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 23:06:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\pasted-image-20250309054521.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;coursework\year-4\semester-2\ench-446-process-econ-&amp;-design-ii\pasted-image-20250309054521.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Urea Process Literature]]></title><description><![CDATA[
